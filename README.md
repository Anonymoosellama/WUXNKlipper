# WUXNKlipper
This is a repo for converting your WUXN 3D printer to run Klipper (Work in Progress)
Currently the display is not supported by the klipper firmware but a work around was created which works with some bugs
Getting Klipper installed is relatively easy, full instruction will be added as this repo is updated
Tuning and profiles have only been created for WUXN's PLA in Prusa Slicer
